An Original Recipe by Not Quite Nigella

Preparation time: 15 minutes

Cooking time: 1.5-2 hours

4-6 tablespoons oil
1.5 kilos beef shin or beef chuck, cut into bite sized pieces
2 onions, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
1 stick celery, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2/3 cup red wine
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 cup sultanas
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1.5-2 cups beef stock (use 2 cups if you want a runnier consistency to the liquid)
50g/1.7 ozs dark chocolate (I used Lindt’s Touch of Sea Salt)
Salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons pine nuts
3 tablespoons chopped parsley
</pre>
Beef shin<br>
1. In a large pot on medium heat, add a tablespoon of the oil and brown the beef in three batches. Set aside. Reduce the heat to low and saute the onions, carrot, celery and garlic until soft but and fragrant, about 5-8 minutes.<br>



2. Turn the heat up to medium again and add the beef back into the pot. Add the red wine and red wine vinegar and cook it for 5 minutes to evaporate the alcohol. Add the sultanas, bay leaves, cinnamon, nutmeg and beef stock and cook in low to medium heat with the lid on for 1.5 hours.<br>



3. When 1.5 hours is up, melt the chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave. Add one tablespoon of the stew liquid to the chocolate and then stir and then add another 3-4 tablespoons until the chocolate has incorporated the liquid well without seizing. Add the chocolate to the stew liquid and simmer for another 30 minutes and season with the salt and pepper to taste. Scatter pine nuts on top and chopped parsley. Serve with potatoes.
